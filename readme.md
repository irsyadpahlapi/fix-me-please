# Fix Me Plz - Back End

You have a buggy-not-runnable-undocumented backend service. It's dead simple, you just have to read the codes very-very carefully.

## Tasks

run `nodemon app.js`, fix the reported errors. Once it runs properly, your work is half done. The rest depends on how well you test it.

> _hint:_ use Postman, Insomnia, curl, etc

## Good luck and have fun! ðŸŽ‰
